# cmazeprogram
C program to demonstrate how to navigate a maze

The program isomh readmap() to load the map.txt file into memory using the struct maptype.

The idea is to demonstrate how you implement the idea of a car nativating around a map/maze.
The code is not meant to be prefect but to inspire programmers to take this simple program and use techniques to navigate the maze and add new features.

For example.
In AI was have Depth First or Breath First Search algorithims.
